Hey how about do something with Cannonball? In nowdays everybody can mount Auxiliary weapon and decide between Mini Razor or Canoonball of cource buy mini razor, lets see closer. Mini Razor in all sides better then cannonball exept range  (MiniR 737 CBall 1500)  but Mini Razor dont need ammo, got bigger damage. How about change cannonball? To make it different from same and better Mini Razor? And i got some variations:
1. ''Spiner Cannonball''-  All stats same except range, make loooong range 4k+- (and still no turn rate)
2. "Strong Cannonball" - No turn rate but more ammo and bigger Hull damage (bigger then Mini Razor)
3. "Torp Cannonball"   same damage but  small turn rate(like before)  maby longer range and  slow speed
4. " Old Cannonball "- return old cannonball with blackjack and girls
5. "Cannonball Cannonball "- half damage more ammo longer range and small turn rate
